### ispwCheckoutPipeline.groovy

Pipeline to be triggered by checking out a task/component in ISPW to an assignment.
Based on information from ISPW three SonarQube project names will be determined

- *stream*_*application*_*assignment*_Unit_Tests
- *stream*_*application*_*assignment*_Functional_Tests
- *stream*_*application*

The projects are supposed to inspect sources and unit test results, or functional test results or the whole application, respectively. 
The pipeline will check if the corresponding projects already exist in SonarQube. 

If not the projects will be created and Quality Gates assigned to them and initial scans will be performed for the corresponding sources. 
For the first two projects based on the components checked out to the assignment. For the last project based on the whole ISPW application.

This process will allow for initial scans and determining new code during the life cycle.
