### ispwCheckoutPipeline.groovy

Pipeline to be triggered by checking out a task/component in ISPW to an assignment.
For each component in the corresponding set, it will check if SonarQube projects already exists. 
The will be two projects project per component, one for unit testing and one for functional testing.

<stream>_<application>_<component_name>_Unit_Tests
<stream>_<application>_<component_name>_Functional_Tests

If a project does not exist, the pipeline will 

- create the two projects
- assign Quality Gates
- run an initial scan for the source

This process will allow for initial scans and determining new code during the life cycle.
